    "section": "",
    "text": "Inspired by this blog post by Stephen Turner, I decided that I would start to record some of the new things (to me, that is!) that I learn, be they big or small.\nSo, a small thing to start. Yesterday I was trying to download some sequencing data from a facility, and couldn’t help thinking that I’d already done this – which a quick search of my command line history confirmed. But I was also keen to know exactly when I’d downloaded the data (mainly to confirm to myself how poor my memory is!), so wanted to print the entire history with dates and times attached.\nTo cut to the chase, the incantation I was looking for is fc -li 1, which gives the command line history from the first event, with date and time in ISO8601 yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm format.\nI was slightly surprised to find that I was to execute fc (“fix command”, a built-in in both Bash and Zsh), rather than some variant of the history built-in (which I thought that I’d been using to look through the command line history since before time began). And I was slightly more surprised to find that history is actually just a built-in alias for fc -l 1. Reaching a (moderate) peak of surprise, I realised that this doesn’t mean that an actual history built-in doesn’t still exist – it can be accessed with builtin history.\nWell, sort of – at least in Bash. For example, in Bash, builtin history 100 shows me the last 100 commands executed, using the history built-in. However in Zsh, builtin history 100 shows the whole command line history, starting at command number 100 – because (according to man zshbuiltins), the history built-in is the “Same as fc -l”. So in Zsh, builtin history 100 is just fc -l 100. But for fc -l, to show events offset from the current event one uses a negative number. So in Zsh, builtin history -100 behaves the same as builtin history 100 in Bash. I think.\nSlightly confusing. Anyway, for now (in Zsh), I’ve made an alias htime to fc -li 1, and I’ll just use that…"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Published in Brain\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive loss of upper and lower motor neurons. ALS is on a pathogenetic disease spectrum with frontotemporal dementia, referred to as ALS-frontotemporal spectrum disorder (ALS-FTSD). For mutations associated with ALS-FTSD, such as the C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion, the molecular factors associated with heterogeneity along this spectrum require further characterization.\nHere, using a targeted NanoString molecular barcoding approach, we interrogate neuroinflammatory dysregulation and heterogeneity at the level of gene expression in post-mortem motor cortex tissue from a cohort of clinically heterogeneous C9-ALS-FTSD cases.\nWe identified 20 dysregulated genes in C9-ALS-FTSD, with enrichment of microglial and inflammatory response gene sets. Two genes with significant correlations to available clinical metrics were selected for validation: FKBP5, a correlate of cognitive function, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a correlate of disease duration. FKBP5 and its signalling partner, NF-κB, appeared to have a cell type-specific staining distribution, with activated (i.e. nuclear) NF-κB immunoreactivity in C9-ALS-FTSD. Expression of BDNF, a correlate of disease duration, was confirmed to be higher in individuals with long compared to short disease duration using BaseScope™ in situ hybridization. Our analyses also revealed two distinct neuroinflammatory panel signatures (NPS), NPS1 and NPS2, delineated by the direction of expression of proinflammatory, axonal transport and synaptic signalling pathways. We compared NPS between C9-ALS-FTSD cases and those from sporadic ALS and SOD1-ALS cohorts and identified NPS1 and NPS2 across all cohorts. Moreover, a subset of NPS was also able to separate publicly available RNA sequencing data from independent C9-ALS and sporadic ALS cohorts into two inflammatory subgroups.\nImportantly, NPS subgroups did not clearly segregate with available demographic, genetic, clinical or pathological features, highlighting the value of molecular stratification in clinical trials for inflammatory subgroup identification. Our findings thus underscore the importance of tailoring therapeutic approaches based on distinct molecular signatures that exist between and within ALS-FTSD cohorts.\nRecommended citation: Olivia M Rifai, Judi O’Shaughnessy, Owen R Dando, Alison F Munro, Michael D E Sewell, Sharon Abrahams, Fergal M Waldron, Christopher R Sibley, Jenna M Gregory, Distinct neuroinflammatory signatures exist across genetic and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cohorts, Brain, Volume 146, Issue 12, December 2023, Pages 5124–5138, https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awad243"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Published in Neuropathology and Applied Neurobiology\nMutations in the MAPT gene encoding tau protein can cause autosomal dominant neurodegenerative tauopathies including frontotemporal dementia (often with Parkinsonism). In Alzheimer’s disease, the most common tauopathy, synapse loss is the strongest pathological correlate of cognitive decline. Recently, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging with synaptic tracers revealed clinically relevant loss of synapses in primary tauopathies; however, the molecular mechanisms leading to synapse degeneration in primary tauopathies remain largely unknown. In this study, we examined post-mortem brain tissue from people who died with frontotemporal dementia with tau pathology (FTDtau) caused by the MAPT intronic exon 10 + 16 mutation, which increases splice variants containing exon 10 resulting in higher levels of tau with four microtubule-binding domains.\nWe used RNA sequencing and histopathology to examine temporal cortex and visual cortex, to look for molecular phenotypes compared to age, sex and RNA integrity matched participants who died without neurological disease (n = 12 FTDtau10 + 16 and 13 controls).\nBulk tissue RNA sequencing reveals substantial downregulation of gene expression associated with synaptic function. Upregulated biological pathways in human MAPT 10 + 16 brain included those involved in transcriptional regulation, DNA damage response and neuroinflammation. Histopathology confirmed increased pathological tau accumulation in FTDtau10 + 16 cortex as well as a loss of presynaptic protein staining and region-specific increased colocalization of phospho-tau with synapses in temporal cortex.\nOur data indicate that synaptic pathology likely contributes to pathogenesis in FTDtau10 + 16 caused by the MAPT 10 + 16 mutation.\nRecommended citation: Dando O, McGeachan R, McQueen J, et al. Synaptic gene expression changes in frontotemporal dementia due to the MAPT 10 + 16 mutation.

    "text": "Published in Molecular Autism\nMutations in the X-linked gene cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) cause a severe neurological disorder characterised by early-onset epileptic seizures, autism and intellectual disability (ID). Impaired hippocampal function has been implicated in other models of monogenic forms of autism spectrum disorders and ID and is often linked to epilepsy and behavioural abnormalities. Many individuals with CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) have null mutations and complete loss of CDKL5 protein, therefore in the current study we used a Cdkl5−/y rat model to elucidate the impact of CDKL5 loss on cellular excitability and synaptic function of CA1 pyramidal cells (PCs). We hypothesised abnormal pre and/or post synaptic function and plasticity would be observed in the hippocampus of Cdkl5−/y rats.\nTo allow cross-species comparisons of phenotypes associated with the loss of CDKL5, we generated a loss of function mutation in exon 8 of the rat Cdkl5 gene and assessed the impact of the loss of CDLK5 using a combination of extracellular and whole-cell electrophysiological recordings, biochemistry, and histology.\nOur results indicate that CA1 hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) is enhanced in slices prepared from juvenile, but not adult, Cdkl5−/y rats. Enhanced LTP does not result from changes in NMDA receptor function or subunit expression as these remain unaltered throughout development. Furthermore, Ca2+ permeable AMPA receptor mediated currents are unchanged in Cdkl5−/y rats. We observe reduced mEPSC frequency accompanied by increased spine density in basal dendrites of CA1 PCs, however we find no evidence supporting an increase in silent synapses when assessed using a minimal stimulation protocol in slices. Additionally, we found no change in paired-pulse ratio, consistent with normal release probability at Schaffer collateral to CA1 PC synapses.\nOur data indicate a role for CDKL5 in hippocampal synaptic function and raise the possibility that altered intracellular signalling rather than synaptic deficits contribute to the altered plasticity.\nRecommended citation: Simões de Oliveira, L., O’Leary, H.E., Nawaz, S. et al. Enhanced hippocampal LTP but normal NMDA receptor and AMPA receptor function in a rat model of CDKL5 deficiency disorder.

    "text": "Published in Nature Neuroscience\nBrain-resident macrophages, microglia, have been proposed to have an active role in synaptic refinement and maturation, influencing plasticity and circuit-level connectivity. Here we show that several neurodevelopmental processes previously attributed to microglia can proceed without them. Using a genetically modified mouse that lacks microglia (Csf1r∆FIRE/∆FIRE), we find that intrinsic properties, synapse number and synaptic maturation are largely normal in the hippocampal CA1 region and somatosensory cortex at stages where microglia have been implicated. Seizure susceptibility and hippocampal-prefrontal cortex coherence in awake behaving animals, processes that are disrupted in mice deficient in microglia-enriched genes, are also normal. Similarly, eye-specific segregation of inputs into the lateral geniculate nucleus proceeds normally in the absence of microglia. Single-cell and single-nucleus transcriptomic analyses of neurons and astrocytes did not uncover any substantial perturbation caused by microglial absence. Thus, the brain possesses remarkable adaptability to execute developmental synaptic refinement, maturation and connectivity in the absence of microglia.\nRecommended citation: O’Keeffe, M., Booker, S.A., Walsh, D. et al. Typical development of synaptic and neuronal properties can proceed without microglia in the cortex and thalamus.

    "text": "Published in Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience\nRodent studies have shown that alternative splicing in neurons plays important roles in development and maturity, and is regulatable by signals such as electrical activity. However, rodent-human similarities are less well explored.\nWe compared basal and activity-dependent exon splicing in cortical-patterned human ESC-derived neurons with that in cortical mouse ESC-derived neurons, primary mouse cortical neurons at two developmental stages, and mouse hippocampal neurons, focussing on conserved orthologous exons. Both basal exon inclusion levels and activity-dependent changes in splicing showed human-mouse correlation. Conserved activity regulated exons are enriched in RBFOX, SAM68, NOVA and PTBP targets, and centered on cytoskeletal organization, mRNA processing, and synaptic signaling genes.\nHowever, human-mouse correlations were weaker than inter-mouse comparisons of neurons from different brain regions, developmental stages and origin (ESC vs. primary), suggestive of some inter-species divergence. The set of genes where activity-dependent splicing was observed only in human neurons were dominated by those involved in lipid biosynthesis, signaling and trafficking. Study of human exon splicing in mouse Tc1 neurons carrying human chromosome-21 showed that neuronal basal exon inclusion was influenced by cis-acting sequences, although may not be sufficient to confer activity-responsiveness in an allospecific environment.\nOverall, these comparisons suggest that neuronal alternative splicing should be confirmed in a human-relevant system even when exon structure is evolutionarily conserved.\nRecommended citation: Dando O, McQueen J, Burr K, Kind PC, Chandran S, Hardingham GE and Qiu J (2024) A comparison of basal and activity-dependent exon splicing in cortical-patterned neurons of human and mouse origin.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Published in Acta Neuropathalogica\nSynapse loss correlates with cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease, and soluble oligomeric amyloid beta (Aβ) is implicated in synaptic dysfunction and loss. An important knowledge gap is the lack of understanding of how Aβ leads to synapse degeneration. In particular, there has been difficulty in determining whether there is a synaptic receptor that binds Aβ and mediates toxicity. While many candidates have been observed in model systems, their relevance to human AD brain remains unknown. This is in part due to methodological limitations preventing visualization of Aβ binding at individual synapses.\nTo overcome this limitation, we combined two high resolution microscopy techniques: array tomography and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) to image over 1 million individual synaptic terminals in temporal cortex from AD (n = 11) and control cases (n = 9). Within presynapses and post-synaptic densities, oligomeric Aβ generates a FRET signal with transmembrane protein 97. Further, Aβ generates a FRET signal with cellular prion protein, and post-synaptic density 95 within post synapses. Transmembrane protein 97 is also present in a higher proportion of post synapses in Alzheimer’s brain compared to controls. We inhibited Aβ/transmembrane protein 97 interaction in a mouse model of amyloidopathy by treating with the allosteric modulator CT1812. CT1812 drug concentration correlated negatively with synaptic FRET signal between transmembrane protein 97 and Aβ.\nIn human-induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons, transmembrane protein 97 is present in synapses and colocalizes with Aβ when neurons are challenged with human Alzheimer’s brain homogenate. Transcriptional changes are induced by Aβ including changes in genes involved in neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. CT1812 treatment of these neurons caused changes in gene sets involved in synaptic function. These data support a role for transmembrane protein 97 in the synaptic binding of Aβ in human Alzheimer’s disease brain where it may mediate synaptotoxicity.\nRecommended citation: Colom-Cadena, M., Toombs, J., Simzer, E. et al. Transmembrane protein 97 is a potential synaptic amyloid beta receptor in human Alzheimer’s disease.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Published in Glia\nWhite matter abnormalities, related to poor cerebral perfusion, are a core feature of small vessel cerebrovascular disease, and critical determinants of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia. Despite this importance there is a lack of treatment options.\nProliferation of microglia producing an expanded, reactive population and associated neuroinflammatory alterations have been implicated in the onset and progression of cerebrovascular white matter disease, in patients and in animal models, suggesting that targeting microglial proliferation may exert protection. Colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R) is a key regulator of microglial proliferation. We found that the expression of CSF1R/Csf1r and other markers indicative of increased microglial abundance are significantly elevated in damaged white matter in human cerebrovascular disease and in a clinically relevant mouse model of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion and vascular cognitive impairment.\nUsing the mouse model, we investigated long-term pharmacological CSF1R inhibition, via GW2580, and demonstrated that the expansion of microglial numbers in chronic hypoperfused white matter is prevented. Transcriptomic analysis of hypoperfused white matter tissue showed enrichment of microglial and inflammatory gene sets, including phagocytic genes that were the predominant expression modules modified by CSF1R inhibition. Further, CSF1R inhibition attenuated hypoperfusion-induced white matter pathology and rescued spatial learning impairments and to a lesser extent cognitive flexibility.\nOverall, this work suggests that inhibition of CSF1R and microglial proliferation mediates protection against chronic cerebrovascular white matter pathology and cognitive deficits. Our study nominates CSF1R as a target for the treatment of vascular cognitive disorders with broader implications for treatment of other chronic white matter diseases.\nRecommended citation: Askew, K.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Published in eLife\nMicroglial endolysosomal (dys)function is strongly implicated in neurodegenerative disease. Transcriptomic studies show that a microglial state characterised by a set of genes involved in endolysosomal function is induced in both mouse Alzheimer’s disease (AD) models and human AD brain, and that the emergence of this state is emphasised in females. Cst7 (encoding cystatin F) is among the most highly upregulated genes in these microglia. However, despite such striking and robust upregulation, the function of Cst7 in neurodegenerative disease is not understood.\nHere, we crossed Cst7-/- mice with the AppNL-G-F mouse to test the role of Cst7 in a model of amyloid-driven AD. Surprisingly, we found that Cst7 plays a sexually dimorphic role regulating microglia in this model. In females, Cst7-/-AppNL-G-F microglia had greater endolysosomal gene expression, lysosomal burden, and amyloid beta (Aβ) burden in vivo and were more phagocytic in vitro. However, in males, Cst7-/-AppNL-G-F microglia were less inflammatory and had a reduction in lysosomal burden but had no change in Aβ burden.\nOverall, our study reveals functional roles for one of the most commonly upregulated genes in microglia across disease models, and the sex-specific profiles of Cst7-/--altered microglial disease phenotypes. More broadly, the findings raise important implications for AD including crucial questions on sexual dimorphism in neurodegenerative disease and the interplay between endolysosomal and inflammatory pathways in AD pathology.\nRecommended citation: Michael JD Daniels, Lucas Lefevre, Stefan Szymkowiak, Alice Drake, Laura McCulloch, Makis Tzioras, Jack Barrington, Owen R Dando, Xin He, Mehreen Mohammad, Hiroki Sasaguri, Takashi Saito, Takaomi C Saido, Tara L Spires-Jones, Barry W McColl (2023), Cystatin F (Cst7) drives sex-dependent changes in microglia in an amyloid-driven model of Alzheimer’s disease, eLife, 12:e85279"
